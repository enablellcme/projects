## Lessons Learned / Notes

### Deployment Challenges
- **GitHub Pages:** Required public repository on free tier
- **GitHub Pages:** First deployment took 5-10 minutes
- **Filename Case Sensitivity:** `Pre-Quote.html` vs `pre-quote.html` - case matters!
- **URL Structure:** Must include full path with filename (no default index.html)

### What Worked Well
- ✅ Client folder structure keeps everything organized
- ✅ Pre-filled client information saves time
- ✅ SOW alignment ensures consistency
- ✅ JSON export/import allows easy client collaboration
- ✅ Modal popup provides context without leaving page
- ✅ GitHub Pages provides free, reliable hosting

### Best Practices Going Forward
1. **Always use consistent filename casing** (prefer lowercase: `pre-quote.html`)
2. **Test URLs immediately** after deployment
3. **Wait 2-5 minutes** for first GitHub Pages deployment
4. **Use client folder structure** for organization
5. **Pre-fill all known client information** before sending
6. **Include README.md** in each client folder for internal notes
7. **Reference SOW** in form metadata for traceability
