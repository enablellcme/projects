### Key Components:
- **Strategic Recommendations Presentation** (8 sections, scrollable)
- **Interactive Decision Framework** (Essential/Collaborative/Managed engagement modes)
- **Client Input Collection** (priorities, goals, budget, timeline, constraints)
- **Export Functionality** (JSON, presentation text, PDF, pre-filled HTML)

---

## Program Objective

**Primary Goal:**
Establish a compliant, scalable digital infrastructure on Zoho to manage quoting, invoicing, payments, and automated commissions for independent sales reps; phase in automation and analytics with clear auditability.

### Guiding Principles:
1. **Compliance-first** - HIPAA-aligned handling of PII/PHI, least-privilege access, auditable logs
2. **MVP-first execution** - Reduce manual work quickly, then iterate
3. **Data integrity** - Single-source-of-truth across CRM and Books
4. **Secure enablement** - 1099 reps access without exposing sensitive financials

### Systems Scope:
- **Core:** Zoho CRM, Zoho Books, Zoho WorkDrive, Zoho Analytics
- **Automation:** Zoho Flow, Zoho Creator (forms/portal prototype)
- **Payments:** Zoho Pay (backup), RunPayment (NMI) primary gateway
- **Document Signing:** Zoho Sign (or DocuSign)

## Session Notes

### **Development Process:**

1. **Initial Request:** Client wanted a decision guide for MGC Supplies based on comprehensive JSON transformation plan

2. **Template Selection:** Used A1 Security HTML decision guide as template (`A1Security/index.html`)

3. **Customization:**
   - Pre-filled MGC Supplies client information
   - Created 24 deliverables organized by 3 phases
   - Built 8-section strategic recommendations presentation
   - Implemented scrollable long-form presentation (instead of slider)
   - Removed Team Composition section per client request
   - Added budget planning, commitment levels, constraints capture

4. **Presentation Evolution:**
   - Initially created as slider with navigation buttons
   - Slider proved awkward with scrolling within slides
   - Converted to scrollable long-form presentation (like Service Levels modal)
   - Much better UX - single scroll, all content visible

5. **File Organization:**
   - Initially created in OneDrive client folder
   - Moved to local Projects/MGC folder for git/deployment
   - Corrected folder name from MCG to MGC
   - Successfully deployed to b2biz.dev domain

### **Key Decisions:**

- **Engagement Framework:** Essential/Collaborative/Managed (consistent with Enable's service model)
- **Unit-based Pricing:** Transparent unit estimates per engagement mode
- **Presentation Format:** Scrollable long-form (better than slider for dense content)
- **Export Options:** Multiple formats to support different workflows
- **Pre-filled Data:** Reduces friction for client, shows attention to detail

### **Source Documents Referenced:**

1. **Advisory Guild JSON GPT Output alignment_10-29-2025.json**
   - Source of transformation plan details
   - Phase breakdowns
   - Deliverables and metrics
   - Risks and mitigations

2. **A1Security/index.html**
   - Template for decision guide structure
   - Engagement framework modal
   - Export/import functionality
   - Enable Solutions branding

### **Technical Challenges Solved:**

- **Slider UX Issue:** Scrolling within slide containers was confusing
  - **Solution:** Converted to long-form scrollable presentation

- **Folder Naming:** MCG vs MGC
  - **Solution:** Git rename operation to fix folder name

- **File Location:** Created in wrong folder initially
  - **Solution:** Manual move + git tracking

### **Client Requirements Met:**

✅ Comprehensive decision guide
✅ Strategic recommendations presentation
✅ Downloadable presentation
✅ Framework for engagement mode selection
✅ Budget and timeline preferences capture
✅ Constraints and dependencies collection
